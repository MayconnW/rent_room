== README

This is a simple project that can help you to create a personal portfolio. 

To install this project is very simple, just clone the project and run the bundle.

Remember that to run this project you need to have the Ruby on Rails configured in your machine. I advise that you use the cloud9 (http://c9.io). This provides all that you need to run rails project's.

After cloned the project follow this steps: 

1 - Run the command "bundle install"

2 - Find the file "config/database.yml" and add your database configuration.

3 - Run the command "rake db:create db:migrate db:seed".

4 - Then run the project "rails -s" ( if you are running at Cloud9 execute "rails -s -b $IP -p $PORT"). 

5 - Access your site path '/admin'. Like as "http://localhost/admin".

6 - Create an user with 'user' role.

7 - Add informations about that user like as projects, experiences,...

8 - Log out from the admin.

9 - Log in now with your created user and see how the page is.

Maybe you need to install the "imagick". Please follow this tutorial "HowToInstallImagick.txt".

I hope that you like this project. And I will add more functions day after day.
